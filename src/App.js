                <p>
                The one great lesson of web design is:  <i>people surf</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                If users don't get value from a web page, quickly -- they move on.  For this reason, Jakob Nielsen recommends engaging the user <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/">within the first 10 seconds</a>.
                </p>
                <p className="center">
                    <a href="https://www.nngroup.com"><img title="Dr. Jakob Nielsen" alt="Dr. Jakob Nielsen" src={nielsen}/></a>
                </p>
                <p>
                User interface design principles address this problem.  We want our user interfaces to achieve <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/make-it-easy-on-the-user-designing-for-discoverability-within-mobile-apps">discoverability</a>:  "the ease at which users can find new features or functions... and learn to use the things that they find."
                </p>
                <p>
                The most easily discovered user interface is one that the users already know.  This is the principle of <i>familiarity</i>:
                </p>
                <ul>
                 <li>"Users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer your site to work the same way." (<a href="https://lawsofux.com/jakobs-law/">Jakob's Law</a>) (Yablonski, 2020)</li>
                    <li>"Use common designs that are familiar to most users." (Seeman-Horwitz, Montgomery, Lee, and Ran, 2021)</li>
                    <li>"Performing learned actions is easy.  Performing novel actions is hard." (Johnson, 2014)</li>
                    <li>"Don't make me think!" (Krug, 2014)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                For zooming, the most familiar user interface includes scrollbars.  Scrollbars show the user where they have zoomed, and where they can zoom.  For these familiar controls, the user has no learning curve.
                </p>
                <p>
                Hover over the graphs below to see the scrollbars.
                </p>
                <h2>In Two Dimensions</h2>
                <p>
                Scrollbars have three purposes:
                </p>
                <ol>
                <li><strong>Navigation:</strong>  they show the user where they are, and where they can go</li>
                <li><strong>Panning:</strong>  they enable the user to pan in one dimension</li>
                <li><strong>Zooming:</strong>  handles on the ends of the scrollbars enable zooming in one dimension.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div className="Graph">
                <ScatterPlot dataSet={ "Iris" } />
            </div>
            <div className="Description">
                <p>
                Scrollbars don't preclude use of the scroll wheel for two-dimensional zooming, or the drag action for two-dimensional panning.  They provide <em>feedback</em> when these actions are performed, and <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/principles/web-design/what-is-affordance-design/">affordance</a> for performing them in one dimension.
                </p>
                <h2>In One Dimension</h2>
                <p>
                The principle of <em>consistency</em> also reduces the user's learning curve.  When users learn how things work in one place, they can apply that knowledge in another.
                </p>
                <p>
                These controls are consistent with the <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/overview-plus-detail/">Overview Plus Detail pattern</a> (Tidwell 2006) (Cockburn, Karlson, and Bederson, 2008).  This combines the scrollbar with an overview of the data for one-dimensional zooming.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div className="Graph">
                <AreaPlot dataSet={ "Stocks" } />
            </div>
            <div className="Description">
                <h2>Design Notes</h2>
                <p>
                This implementation reuses some code from the <a href="https://observablehq.com/collection/@d3/d3-zoom">d3-zoom collection</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                To minimize distraction from the data display, controls are fully displayed only when they can be used.  Controls are discoverable by hovering over the graph.
                </p>
                <p>
                When there are no limits to the data, scrollbars are not needed, for example in maps that cover the globe.  When there are limits to the data, scrollbars show those limits, and prevent the user from accidentally scrolling into areas of no data.
                </p>
                <p>
                A drag action in the data display can support panning, but it may be used for other purposes: for example, to drag a rectangle and zoom in on that area, or to drag a brush.  The scrollbars free the drag action to be used for other purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                This design follows desktop standards; a mobile design would apply the same principles.  On mobile devices, the user can't hover, but scrollbars are unobtrusive:  they grow when the user scrolls, and shrink when they stop.  Because of the pinch gesture, scrollbars don't need handles.
                </p>
                <p>
                The user always has some goal, and it's never to learn our user interfaces (no matter how much we admire them!).  For this reason, our goal must be to get the user value, quickly.  We can achieve discoverability through familiarity, by following standards.  This ensures that our user interfaces are easily learned, because they are already known.
