                The one great lesson of web design is:  <i>people surf</i>.

                Jakob Nielsen recommends engaging the user <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/">within the first 10 seconds</a> -- because if users don't find value in a web page, quickly, they move on.

                </p>
                <p>
                For this reason, we want our user interfaces to achieve <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/make-it-easy-on-the-user-designing-for-discoverability-within-mobile-apps">discoverability</a>:  "the ease at which users can find new features or functions... and learn to use the things that they find."
                </p>
                <p>
                The most easily discovered user interface is one that the users already know.  This is the principle of <a href="https://www.educative.io/answers/what-are-learnability-principles-for-usability">familiarity</a>:
                </p>
                <ul>
                 <li>"Users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer your site to work the same way." (<a href="https://lawsofux.com/jakobs-law/">Jakob's Law</a>) (Yablonski, 2020)</li>
                    <li>"Performing learned actions is easy.  Performing novel actions is hard." (Johnson, 2014)</li>
                    <li>"Use common designs that are familiar to most users." (Seeman-Horwitz et. al., 2021)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                For zooming, a familiar user interface includes scrollbars.  Scrollbars show the user that they can zoom and where they have zoomed.  For these familiar controls, the user has no learning curve.
                </p>
                <p>
                Hover over the graphs below to see the scrollbars.
                </p>
                <h2>In Two Dimensions</h2>
            </div>
            <div className="Graph">
                <ScatterPlot dataSet={ "Iris" } />
            </div>
            <div className="Description">
                <p>
                Scrollbars don't preclude use of the scroll wheel for zooming, or the drag action for panning.  However, these actions have no <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/principles/web-design/what-is-affordance-design/">affordance</a>.  Not all graphs can be zoomed and panned.  Scrollbars show which ones can.
                </p>
                <p>
                Scrollbars are also easier for users who don't have a scroll wheel, or have difficulty using one.  Handles on the ends of the scrollbars enable zooming in one dimension.
                </p>
                <h2>In One Dimension</h2>
                <p>
                The <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/overview-plus-detail/">Overview Plus Detail pattern</a> combines the scrollbar with an overview of the data (Tidwell 2006) (Cockburn et. al., 2008).
                </p>
            </div>
            <div className="Graph">
                <AreaPlot dataSet={ "Stocks" } />
            </div>
            <div className="Description">
                <p>
                Drawing 1D and 2D scrollbars in consistent styles is another way to ease the user's learning curve.  Following the principle of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/consistency-and-standards/">consistency</a> enables users to learn how things work in one place, then apply that knowledge in another.
                </p>
                <h2>Design Notes</h2>
                <p>
                This implementation reuses some code from the <a href="https://observablehq.com/collection/@d3/d3-zoom">d3-zoom collection</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                To minimize distraction from the data display, controls are fully displayed only when they can be used.
                </p>
                <p>
                A drag action in the data display supports panning.  Because scrollbars also support panning, this frees the drag action.  It could be used for other purposes, for example to drag a brush.
                </p>
                <p>
                For a positive experience, the user must discover how to use our software quickly.  We can achieve discoverability through familiarity.  This ensures that our user interfaces are easily learned, because they are already known.
                </p>
