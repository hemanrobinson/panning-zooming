# Discoverable Zooming

What is the most easily learned user interface for zooming a graph?
              
The most familiar user interface uses plus (+) and minus (-) buttons, with scroll bars to provide panning and user feedback.  Handles on the ends of the scroll bars support one-dimensional zooming.

[This project demonstrates a user interface for zooming.  The elements of this design are easily learned because they are familiar.](https://hemanrobinson.github.io/zoom/)
