# Discoverable Zooming

[This project demonstrates a discoverable user interface for zooming.](https://hemanrobinson.github.io/zoom/)

Scrollbars provide visual feedback that enables the user to discover where they have zoomed, and where they can zoom.  Handles on the ends of the scroll bars support one-dimensional zooming.
